## Context and Prompt Engineering

[Prompt engineering](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/introduction-prompt-engineering-with-github-copilot/) is the process of crafting specific prompts or input queries for AI models to generate desired outputs. 

### Microsoft’s 4 S’s
*Single*: Always focus your prompt on a single, well-defined task or question. This clarity is crucial for eliciting accurate and useful responses from Copilot. Approach prompts as a small-batch problem. A larger number of smaller prompts targeted at specific problems generally produces better results. 

*Specific*: Ensure that your instructions are explicit and detailed. Specificity leads to more applicable and precise code suggestions.

*Short*: While being specific, keep prompts concise and to the point. This balance ensures clarity without overloading Copilot or complicating the interaction.  

*Surround*: Utilize descriptive filenames and keep related files open. This provides Copilot with rich context, leading to more tailored code suggestions. Including variable names, function signatures, data types, or example inputs and outputs helps GitHub Copilot understand the problem better. You can also provide pseudocode, code snippets, or partial implementations in your prompt to guide GitHub Copilot in generating the desired code. This can help ensure that the generated code aligns with your expectations and coding style.

<!--
### Clear Problem Statement
Provide a clear and concise problem statement in your prompt. Clearly outline what you're trying to achieve and any specific requirements or constraints.

### Small Batch Prompts 
Break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable prompts. This can help GitHub Copilot generate more accurate and relevant code snippets for each specific task.

### Specific Keywords
Use specific keywords or phrases related to the problem domain in your prompt. This can help GitHub Copilot better understand the problem and generate more contextually relevant code. For example: “Create a function to sort an array of integers in ascending order.”
Keywords: "function", "sort", "array", "integers", "ascending order"

### Contextual Information
Include relevant context information in your prompt to help GitHub Copilot understand the problem better. This could include variable names, function signatures, data types, or example inputs and outputs.
### Pseudocode and Code Snippets
Provide example code snippets or partial implementations in your prompt to guide GitHub Copilot in generating the desired code. This can help ensure that the generated code aligns with your expectations and coding style.

### Iterate
The code generated by Copilot might not be usable after the first prompt. Delete it and adjust the prompt, iterating until the code generated looks correct and is usable.  

### Feedback Loop
Continuously review and provide feedback on the generated code to improve its accuracy and relevance over time. GitHub Copilot learns from user interactions, so the more feedback you provide, the better it becomes at generating code tailored to your needs.

### Documentation and Comments

Ensure that the generated code is well-documented and includes appropriate comments to improve readability and maintainability. Add comments to explain the purpose of each code block, function, or variable.

### Testing

Test the generated code thoroughly to ensure that it functions correctly and meets the desired requirements. Write unit tests or integration tests to validate the behavior of the code in different scenarios.
