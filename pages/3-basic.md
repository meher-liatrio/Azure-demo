# Copilot in Action: The Basics

## First Look At the Copilot Experience

Let's start by exploring the Copilot Interface. We will be using the VSCode Copilot integration for this workshop, however the general feature set will be the same across all IDE’s that are compatible with Copilot.

Here we can see the beginning of a Golang project, and Copilot is instantly ready to help the user get started. Let’s say we want to quickly generate a function that calculates factorials. Let’s ask Copilot!

I know that I need to generate a “go.mod” file to manage my dependencies, but I haven’t worked with Go in awhile so I’m not sure off the top of my head how to go about this. We’ll turn to Copilot.

Using the chat functionality, I’ve asked Copilot to generate a go.mod file. As we can see, Copilot instantly provides a detailed response and although it was not able to generate the file for me, since it can’t access the terminal, it has provided clear details on how I can generate the necessary files.

Following Copilot's advice has allowed me to quickly get a Golang project up and running, despite my unfamiliarity with the language. We’re essentially pairing with a domain expert whose knowledge extends almost infinitely. However, as powerful as a tool that Copilot is, it’s also important to keep in mind its limitations and shortcomings. We’ll cover more on that topic in a later section.

## Copilot Capabilities At a Glance

Now that we’ve seen how Copilot can immediately provide value, let’s take a look at some of its other functionalities. From the plugin documentation:

With GitHub Copilot in VS Code you can:
- Get inline code suggestions while you're writing and iterating on code.
- Start a chat conversation to generate or refactor source code, produce documentation comments, or generate unit tests.
- Get help with fixing errors in your code, or resolve error while running commands in the terminal.
- Ask questions to help ramp-up on a new code base, or accelerate learning a new programming language or framework.
- Use chat features to discover and configure your VS Code setup.

As we can see, Copilot provides many different ways to be utilized based on the current need and user preference. A lot of mileage can be gained by utilizing even one of Copilot's dynamic capabilities, but becoming truly familiar with the tool and the options at your disposal will really take your development experience to the next level.
