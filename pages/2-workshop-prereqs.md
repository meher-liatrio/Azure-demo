# Workshop Prerequisites

## Licensing

GitHub Copilot is available to anyone with a GitHub Pro, Team, or Enterprise account. If one of these license types is not available, a free 30-day trial can be used for the workshop, if it has not already been used more than 30 days ago.

## Installation Process

VSCode will be the tool of choice for the workshop. Participants can use any editor or IDE that they are comfortable with, but the workshop will not cover how to install or use Copilot with any other editor or IDE. For VSCode, there will be two options for participants:

- Locally installed VS Code
- Browser-based VS Code

In both cases, participants will install the Copilot and Copilot Chat extensions.
