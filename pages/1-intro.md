## GitHub Copilot versus the Field
While Copilot is not the only AI developer tool available, it sets itself apart from the competition in a few ways that are worth noting.

### Base Training Data & Model
Copilot is trained on a wide variety of public code repositories, giving it a variety of coding languages, styles, and practices to draw from.  While this can be a double-edged sword at times, it does result in a very broad range of languages, frameworks, and styles that Copilot can assist with.

### Integration Into the GitHub Ecosystem

Copilot is available directly within GitHub, making it easy to use and integrate into existing development workflows. If a team is already using GitHub, Copilot can be a natural extension of their existing workflow.

### Variety of Interfaces  
Even if teams aren't using GitHub or VSCode, Copilot has a growing list of plugins, making it available to a variety of editors and IDEs. For those using VSCode, Copilot has both chat and code completion capabilities.


### Prompt Engineering  
Having the option to utilize prompt engineering within GitHub Copilot allows teams to both tailor and improve their experience. This can help to ensure that Copilot is providing the most relevant and useful suggestions for the team's specific needs.
