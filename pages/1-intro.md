# What is GitHub Copilot?
Let's just ask Copilot itself!

<div v-click style="position: relative; width: 600px; height: 400px; margin: 0 auto;">

![macbook](/macbook.png){ style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" }

![ask-copilot](/what-is-copilot.gif){ style="position: absolute; top: 12%; left: 75px; width: 75%; height: 75%" }

</div>

<!-- 
While copilot gives a simple explanation of what it is, it's important to note that it's an AI tool that is embedded across the GitHub ecosystem, would likely make sense to talk about this more in depth in the next slide.

## GitHub Copilot versus the Field
While Copilot is not the only AI developer tool available, it sets itself apart from the competition in a few ways that are worth noting.

<!--
- Model: The base model for copilot is primarily GPT-4.  However, GitHub has also updated the codex model to be more efficient and learn from the code being written and accepted by the user.  This is a helpful blog to read before speaking to this topic https://github.blog/2023-02-14-github-copilot-now-has-a-better-ai-model-and-new-capabilities/
- Ecosystem: Copilot in the IDE is the 1st place it appeared.  However, it's currently showing up in github.com, pull requests, and will continue to expand to other areas of the GitHub ecosystem.  Could speak to potential integrations and how they could be beneficial.  (ex. GitHub Project integration for writing better stories, GitHub Action integrations for troubleshooting failed workflows)
- Interfaces: The primary place Cpilot is being used is the IDE.  There are a variety of IDEs that support Copilot.  This is a helpful link to reference https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-in-your-environment
- Prompt Engineering: This is a new concept that GitHub has introduced to help users get the most out of Copilot.  Being able to speak to how copilot learns from the user and how to prompt it to give the best results is important.  This is a helpful link to reference https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/introduction-prompt-engineering-with-github-copilot/
